## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Database Issues

- Ensure Derby Server is running:  
  - In NetBeans, go to **Services > Databases**  
  - Right-click **Java DB** → **Start Server**

- Verify the database connection:  
  - In **Services > Databases**, find `jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/iotbay`  
  - Right-click → **Connect**  
  - Expand connection to check tables like Users, Device, Orders, etc.

- If tables are missing, rerun `DatabaseInitializer.java` as described above.
